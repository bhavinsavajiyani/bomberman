## What it Actually Is?

If you are a fan of Video-Games, there are hardly any chances that you wouldn't have heard of "Bomberman". A game of its time, the original Bomberman was a classic pixel-art game, released in 1983. Well, if you got connected to the vibe of original Bomberman of Retro times, just hold on to it and try to connect with the modern, revamped prototype of original Bomberman, attached in this repository!
You might feel the Retro being Re-Lived in the Modern World! ðŸ™Š

Regardless of the era in which the video-game was released, you hardly require any reason for NOT playing such an Arcade ðŸ˜œ! Whenever you feel like destroying the walls around you, just switch over to the outfit of "Player" and enter the virtual world of walls and treasure! Destroy the barriers coming in your way, by bombarding them with "Bombs", and of course reach out for the destruction of Oppenent, in order to attain a glorious Victory! ðŸ˜‡
